The design was done in Fusion 360 and stays close to the original dimensions of a standard cassette tape. Neodymium magnets are used to snap the case shut.
 
The PiZero is currently running a headless install of Raspbian. I would like to revise the case to include some type of momentary switches along with a breakout for some of the GPIO pins.
 
When SSHing into the device, a python script is launched to emulate the boot sequence of an old terminal.
